### Setting up the project:

#### Node & NPM version

- Install nodejs and npm.
- This project needs a fixed nodejs version:
  - Nodejs version: `v14.17.6`
  - NPM version: `6.14.15`

#### Recommended:

Use `nvm` to install and manage different versions of nodejs on a single machine.
If you have `nvm` installed on the machine, use `nvm use` command to automatically switch to the specific nodejs version required by the project (As defined in the `.nvmrc` file in the root folder)

#### Running the attached code

- You can use the attached code simply to compare it to yours. But you can also run it.
- To run my code, navigate into a specific code snapshot folder via the `cd` **command in your command prompt or terminal** first.
- Then run `npm install` to install all required dependencies (this will create a `/node_modules` folder).
- **Important**: If you're using the code for a module that requires API keys or a backend (e.g. the module about sending Http requests), you'll have to use your backend URLs or API keys. Mine won't work (I disabled my projects)

- For project run command `npm start`
